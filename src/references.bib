  abstract = {Plants have a complex chemo-diversity and represent a reservoir of potential new therapeutic agents. Within a Swiss research project, six scientific research groups from different disciplines are collaborating to investigate a collection of more than 17'000 unique dried plant extracts. It aims to find new bioactive molecules and their modes of action, with for example anti-infective or pro-metabolic activities. One of the main challenges of this enterprise is the management, integration and sharing of the highly heterogeneous data that are produced by the different research groups. Among these we find (i) massive high-resolution mass spectrometry data, (ii) the numerical results of innovative chemo-informatics methods, (iii) bioassay results from experimental models of tuberculosis and obesity, and (iv) organic synthetic chemistry. Additionally, requirements for data management plan and open-source science with the FAIR principles must be met. We have established an agile pipeline to capture and structure this heterogeneous data into an RDF graph. The data content's gradual expansion and evolution throughout the project presented considerable challenges, particularly in terms of data modeling. Additionally, despite many collaborators not being RDF experts, most were technically adept at producing RDF triples relevant to their contributions. We have deployed multiple instances of a triplestore and developed an in-house custom tool (i.e. KGSteward) to synchronize their content, based on a configuration file, which is centrally managed and version-controlled using Git. This strategy gave us the flexibility required to address global project challenges in common data management effectively.},

This Data Descriptor details a dataset resulting from the untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolite profiling of 76 natural extracts of the Celastraceae family. The spectral annotation results and related chemical and taxonomic metadata are shared, along with proposed examples of data reuse. This data can be further studied by researchers exploring the chemical diversity of natural products. This can serve as a reference sample set for deep metabolome investigation of this chemically rich plant family.},

  abstract = {Introduction               In contrast to the dynamics observed in plant/pathogen interactions, endophytic fungi have the capacity to establish enduring associations within their hosts, leading to the development of a mutually beneficial relationship that relies on specialized chemical interactions. Research indicates that the presence of endophytic fungi has the ability to significantly modify the chemical makeup of the host organism. Our hypothesis proposes the existence of a reciprocal exchange of chemical signals between plants and fungi, facilitated by specialized chemical processes that could potentially manifest within the tissues of the host. This research aimed to precisely quantify the portion of the cumulative fungal endophytic community's metabolome detectable within host leaves, and tentatively evaluate its relevance to the host-endophyte interplay. The understory palm Astrocaryum sciophilum (Miq.) Pulle was used as a interesting host plant because of its notable resilience and prolonged life cycle, in a tropical ecosystem.                                         Method               Using advanced metabolome characterization, including UHPLC-HRMS/MS and molecular networking, the study explored enriched metabolomes of both host leaves and 15 endophytic fungi. The intention was to capture a metabolomic "snapshot" of both host and endophytic community, to achieve a thorough and detailed analysis.                                         Results and discussion               This approach yielded an extended MS-based molecular network, integrating diverse metadata for identifying host- and endophyte-derived metabolites. The exploration of such data (\&gt;24000 features in positive ionization mode) enabled effective metabolome comparison, yielding insights into cultivable endophyte chemodiversity and occurrence of common metabolites between the holobiont and its fungal communities. Surprisingly, a minor subset of features overlapped between host leaf and fungal samples despite significant plant metabolome enrichment. This indicated that fungal metabolic signatures produced in vitro remain sparingly detectable in the leaf. Several classes of primary metabolites were possibly shared. Specific fungal metabolites and/or compounds of their chemical classes were only occasionally discernible in the leaf, highlighting endophytes partial contribution to the overall holobiont metabolome. To our knowledge, the metabolomic study of a plant host and its microbiome has rarely been performed in such a comprehensive manner. The general analytical strategy proposed in this paper seems well-adapted for any study in the field of microbial- or microbiome-related MS and can be applied to most host-microbe interactions.},

In this study, we investigated three phylogenetically closely related               Streptomyces               strains (B5, B91, and B135) isolated from three distinct soil samples in Sudan. Despite belonging to the same species, these strains exhibited different ranges of               Phytophthora infestans               inhibition. The objective of this work was to identify the active compound(s) responsible for the inhibition of               P. infestans               and of other plant pathogens by comparing the genomes and metabolomes of the three strains which showed distinct activity patterns: B5 was the strongest inhibitor of oomycetes, B5 and B91 both inhibited most fungi and B135 was the only strain showing antibacterial activity. Our comparative genomic and metabolomic analysis identified borrelidin as the bioactive compound underlying B5's strong anti-oomycete activity and highlighted a few other metabolites as putative candidates underlying the strains' antifungal and antibacterial activities. This study illustrates the power of comparative genomics and metabolomics on phylogenetically closely related strains of differing activities to highlight bioactive compounds that could contribute to new sustainable crop protection strategies.},

  abstract = {Antibiotics resistance is a clear threat to the future of current tuberculosis treatments like rifampicin, prompting the need for new treatment options in this field. While plants can offer a plethora of chemical diversity in their constitutive natural products to tackle this issue, finding potentially bioactive compounds in them has not always proven to be that simple. Classical bioactivity-guided fractionation approaches are still trendy, but they bear significant shortfalls, like their time-consuming nature as well as the ever-increasing risk of isolating known bioactive compounds. In this regard, we have developed an alternative method to the latter approach that allows for natural derivatives of a known bioactive scaffold to be efficiently targeted and isolated within a large library of plant extracts. Hence our approach allows for the anticipation of bioactive structure independently of preliminary bioassays. By relying on the chemical diversity of a set of 1,600 plant extracts analyzed by HRMS/MS, we were able to isolate and characterize several minor derivatives of a previously reported bioactive aza-anthraquinone compound from               Cananga brandisiana               , selected within the plant set. Assessment of bioactivity on these derivatives (especially onychine, with an IC               50               value of 39~{\textmu}M in infection) confirmed their expected activity on               Mycobacterium marinum               in our anti-infective assay. This proof-of-concept study has established an original path towards bioactive compounds isolation, with the advantage of potentially highlighting minor bioactive compounds, whose activity may not even be detectable at the extract level.},

  abstract = {The metabolome is the biochemical basis of plant form and function, but we know little about its macroecological variation across the plant kingdom. Here, we used the plant functional trait concept to interpret leaf metabolome variation among 457 tropical and 339 temperate plant species. Distilling metabolite chemistry into five metabolic functional traits reveals that plants vary on two major axes of leaf metabolic specialization---a leaf chemical defense spectrum and an expression of leaf longevity. Axes are similar for tropical and temperate species, with many trait combinations being viable. However, metabolic traits vary orthogonally to life-history strategies described by widely used functional traits. The metabolome thus expands the functional trait concept by providing additional axes of metabolic specialization for examining plant form and function.           ,              Leaf metabolic traits describe additional dimensions of plant life-history variation that expand the functional trait concept.},

  abstract = {Abstract             As privileged structures, natural products often display potent biological activities. However, the discovery of novel bioactive scaffolds is often hampered by the chemical complexity of the biological matrices they are found in. Large natural extract collections are thus extremely valuable for their chemical novelty potential but also complicated to exploit in the frame of drug-discovery projects. In the end, it is the pure chemical substances that are desired for structural determination purposes and bioactivity evaluation. Researchers interested in the exploration of large and chemodiverse extract collections should thus establish strategies aiming to efficiently tackle such chemical complexity and access these structures. Establishing carefully crafted digital layers documenting the spectral and chemical complexity as well as bioactivity results of natural extracts collections can help prioritize time-consuming but mandatory isolation efforts. In this note, we report the results of our initial exploration of a collection of 1,600 plant extracts in the frame of a drug-discovery effort. After describing the taxonomic coverage of this collection, we present the results of its liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometric profiling and the exploitation of these profiles using computational solutions. The resulting annotated mass spectral dataset and associated chemical and taxonomic metadata are made available to the community, and data reuse cases are proposed. We are currently continuing our exploration of this plant extract collection for drug-discovery purposes (notably looking for novel antitrypanosomatids, anti-infective and prometabolic compounds) and ecometabolomics insights. We believe that such a dataset can be exploited and reused by researchers interested in computational natural products exploration.},

These NPs hold significant importance in various domains, notably medicine, agriculture, and ecology. A primary resource for our research is the LOTUS database, which catalogues a vast array of NPs and their occurrence. Yet, a gap exists: there are no existing model to predict the occurrence of these NPs across different species.           In our initial strategy, the occurrence of natural products was viewed as a collection of observations and their associated variables. Although simple, this strategy immediately showed its limits when dealing with the complex nature of NPs. We switched to an advanced graph-based method after seeing the necessity for a more thorough strategy to accurately represent the intricate interactions governing NPs expression. When considering species in a phylogeny or molecular pathways, the graph-based method perceives data as a network of connected entities, offering a far more logical and natural way of thinking. By employing this better methodology, we have developed a more effective approach for investigating the intricate world of Natural Products. We hope that this strategy will open up new research directions and possibly result in ground-breaking NP-related findings.},

Central to the success of DBGI is the creation of an interactive platform for both humans and machines to assimilate this knowledge. This report outlines our efforts to design the prototype of a data visualization portal intended to evolve into the DBGI dashboard. Starting with a Plotly Dash application, the project transitioned to a Node.js application leveraging Javascript, HTML, and CSS for enhanced customization. This provides a basis for future improvements, some of which are proposed in the report.},

  abstract = {Natural products represent an inexhaustible source of novel therapeutic agents. Their complex and constrained three-dimensional structures endow these molecules with exceptional biological properties, thereby giving them a major role in drug discovery programs. However, the search for new bioactive metabolites is hampered by the chemical complexity of the biological matrices in which they are found. The purification of single constituents from such matrices requires such a significant amount of work that it should be ideally performed only on molecules of high potential value (i.e., chemical novelty and biological activity). Recent bioinformatics approaches based on mass spectrometry metabolite profiling methods are beginning to address the complex task of compound identification within complex mixtures. However, in parallel to these developments, methods providing information on the bioactivity potential of natural products prior to their isolation are still lacking and are of key interest to target the isolation of valuable natural products only. In the present investigation, we propose an integrated analysis strategy for bioactive natural products prioritization. Our approach uses massive molecular networks embedding various informational layers (bioactivity and taxonomical data) to highlight potentially bioactive scaffolds within the chemical diversity of crude extracts collections. We exemplify this workflow by targeting the isolation of predicted active and nonactive metabolites from two botanical sources (Bocquillonia nervosa and Neoguillauminia cleopatra) against two biological targets (Wnt signaling pathway and chikungunya virus replication). Eventually, the detection and isolation processes of a daphnane diterpene orthoester and four 12-deoxyphorbols inhibiting the Wnt signaling pathway and exhibiting potent antiviral activities against the CHIKV virus are detailed. Combined with efficient metabolite annotation tools, this bioactive natural products prioritization pipeline proves to be efficient. Implementation of this approach in drug discovery programs based on natural extract screening should speed up and rationalize the isolation of bioactive natural products.},

In this study, we investigated three phylogenetically closely related               Streptomyces               strains (B5, B91, and B135) isolated from three distinct soil samples in Sudan. Despite belonging to the same species, these strains exhibited different ranges of               Phytophthora infestans               inhibition. The objective of this work was to identify the active compound(s) responsible for the inhibition of               P. infestans               and of other plant pathogens by comparing the genomes and metabolomes of the three strains which showed distinct activity patterns: B5 was the strongest inhibitor of oomycetes, B5 and B91 both inhibited most fungi and B135 was the only strain showing antibacterial activity. Our comparative genomic and metabolomic analysis identified borrelidin as the bioactive compound underlying B5's strong anti-oomycete activity and highlighted a few other metabolites as putative candidates underlying the strains' antifungal and antibacterial activities. This study illustrates the power of comparative genomics and metabolomics on phylogenetically closely related strains of differing activities to highlight bioactive compounds that could contribute to new sustainable crop protection strategies.},
